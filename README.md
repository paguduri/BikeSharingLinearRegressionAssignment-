## General Information

### Project Information

> The project is a Machine Learning project that uses the Bikes Sharing data set to predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not.

### Project Background

> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

### Project Statement

> The company wants to know: Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and How well those variables describe the bike demands

### Data Set

> The data set is a csv file with the data for the Bikes sharing.


## Conclusions

Significant variables to predict the demand for shared bikes

 - holiday
 - temp
 - hum
 - windspeed
 - Season
 - months(January, July, September, November, December)
 - Year (2019)
 - Sunday
 - weathersit( Light Snow, Mist + Cloudy)
